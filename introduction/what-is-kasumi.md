# What is Kasumi.js?

[Kasumi.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/kasumi.js) is a easy to use framework for building KOOK bots.

## Wow, then what is it good for?

I don't even know. The only reason you should use Kasumi.js is probably the fact that no other libraries are still under active maintainance, oof.
